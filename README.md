# MapOfStars
Website project for university, that shows what the night sky looks like at a given time and place. 
This project uses 2 libraries: 
1. D3 Celestial by ofrohn https://github.com/ofrohn/d3-celestial
2. ReImg by gillyb https://github.com/gillyb/reimg

The website is based on the idea of having a changing map of night sky. The map is created with the D3 Celestial library with custom UI elements. The map can be moved around and zoomed into. You can enable the names of constellations, the constellations themselves, their borders, names of some stars, visibility of Moon, Sun and planets. The time and date can be set up. There was an integrated google map, where you could pick a spot and the sky map will change to show what the sky would look like from that place. The google map doesn't currently work because of the need for Google API.
